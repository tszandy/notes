## Feature Comparison: Knowledge Base (KB) vs Knowledge Graph (KG)

| Feature             | Knowledge Base (KB)                                                  | Knowledge Graph (KG)                                                   |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Representation      | Structured, often table-like/relational database¹                    | Graph-based (nodes and edges), emphasizing relationships¹              |
| Flexibility         | More rigid, based on predefined schemas¹                             | More flexible for complex, interconnected relationships¹               |
| Interconnectedness  | Focuses on efficient storage and retrieval, less emphasis on complex relationships¹ | Excels at capturing and representing interconnected data¹²            |
| Standards           | May use various database technologies; not necessarily semantic web standards¹ | Often adheres to semantic web standards (RDF, OWL)¹³                   |
| Core Focus          | Centralized repository of information and facts¹                     | Relationships between entities¹²⁴                                     |
