isNaN(variable) # determine if a variable is NaN.
 

# iterate through hashmap


It is true that JavaScript supports overriding not overloading. When you define multiple functions 
which has the same name, the last one defined will override all the previously defined ones and 
every time when you invoke a function, the last defined one will get executed.

def f1(arg1,arg2){
  return arguments.length
}

f1.name # return function name in string
eval('f1') # return function reference of function with name f1
