A **knowledge graph** is a structured representation of entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. It organizes data into a network of interconnected nodes and edges, often used in AI and data analysis. Below is the **basic structure of a knowledge graph**:

---

### 1. **Nodes (Entities):**
   - Represent objects, concepts, or items in the domain.
   - Examples: "Person," "City," "Book," "Company."
   - Each node may have unique identifiers and properties.

   **Example:**
   - Node: "Albert Einstein"

---

### 2. **Edges (Relationships):**
   - Represent connections or relationships between nodes.
   - Directed edges typically indicate the direction of the relationship.
   - Examples: "is a scientist," "lives in," "authored."

   **Example:**
   - Relationship: "discovered" connects "Albert Einstein" to "Theory of Relativity."

---

### 3. **Attributes (Properties):**
   - Key-value pairs describing nodes or relationships.
   - Attributes for nodes: Name, age, location, etc.
   - Attributes for edges: Strength, type, date, etc.

   **Example:**
   - Node: "Albert Einstein" â†’ Attributes: {name: "Albert Einstein", profession: "Physicist"}.

---

### 4. **Ontology (Schema):**
   - The schema or framework defining the types of nodes, relationships, and attributes allowed in the graph.
   - Helps maintain consistency and semantic meaning.

   **Example:**
   - "Person" can have attributes like "Name" and "Birthdate."
   - "Person" can have relationships like "works at" or "knows."

---

### 5. **Triples:**
   - The fundamental unit of a knowledge graph is a triple: **(Subject, Predicate, Object)**.
   - **Example:** ("Albert Einstein", "discovered", "Theory of Relativity").

---

### 6. **Graph Structure:**
   - A visual network or linked data representation.
   - Nodes are connected by edges forming a graph-like structure.

   **Example Graph:**
   - Node 1: "Albert Einstein"
   - Node 2: "Theory of Relativity"
   - Edge: "discovered" (from Node 1 to Node 2)

---

### Example in Action:
Imagine a knowledge graph about famous scientists:
- Nodes: "Albert Einstein," "Isaac Newton," "Theory of Relativity," "Gravity."
- Edges: "discovered," "influenced by."
- Triples: 
  - ("Albert Einstein", "discovered", "Theory of Relativity")
  - ("Albert Einstein", "influenced by", "Isaac Newton")
