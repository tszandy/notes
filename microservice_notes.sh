A **microservice** is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independently deployable services that:

1. **Are loosely coupled** – Each service is independent and communicates with others via well-defined APIs, typically over HTTP/REST, gRPC, or messaging queues.
2. **Focus on a single business capability** – A microservice typically handles one specific function, such as user authentication, payment processing, or inventory management.
3. **Can be developed and deployed independently** – Teams can work on different services in parallel, using different programming languages or technologies if needed.
4. **Scale independently** – Services can be scaled horizontally based on demand without affecting the rest of the system.
5. **Include their own data storage** – Each service often manages its own database, promoting data encapsulation and reducing dependencies.

### Example

In an e-commerce platform:

* One microservice might handle **orders**
* Another handles **payments**
* Another handles **shipping**

Each of these services can be updated, deployed, or scaled without requiring changes to the others.

### Benefits

* Better scalability and flexibility
* Easier to maintain and evolve
* Faster time to market for new features
* Fault isolation (failure in one service doesn’t crash the entire system)

### Challenges

* Complexity in communication and data consistency
* Increased operational overhead (e.g., monitoring, deployment, logging)
* Requires good DevOps practices and infrastructure
