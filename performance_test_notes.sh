# type of performance test
Baseline Testing (Capacity Testing)
    This type of testing establishes the system's current performance level and sets a benchmark for future testing and improvement.
    Tests how many users the system can handle before performance dips below acceptable levels. By testing a software’s capacity it helps developers anticipate issues in terms of scalability and future user-base growth. 
Load Testing
    Confirms that the system can handle the required number of users and still operate at a high level of performance. This ensures that there is no day to day issues in performance. 
Stress Testing
    Intentionally tries to break the software by simulating a number of users that greatly exceeds expectations. The launch day of a new iPhone and the sudden spike in user traffic on the Apple website is a good example of a stress test in the real world. https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-store-crashes-as-iphone-6-goes-on-sale-2014-9?r=US&IR=T
Spike Testing 
    Spike testing involves testing the system's ability to handle sudden, large spikes in traffic or user activity.
Volume Testing
    Checks that the software can handle and process a large amount of data at once without breaking, slowing down, or losing any information.  
    Volume testing involves testing the system's ability to handle a large volume of data or transactions.
Soak Testing (Endurance Testing)
    Simulates high traffic for an extended period of time. Checks the software’s ability to tolerate extended periods of high traffic.
    This type of testing is performed to check the system's stability and performance over a prolonged period.
Scalability Testing
    Scalability testing involves testing the system's ability to handle an increasing workload by adding more resources, such as hardware, software, or network capacity.
