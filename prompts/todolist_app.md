I need to create a todolist app. 
1. add golang devcontainer that run as current user
2. it will have golang backend. 
3. it will host react front end. 
4. host in postgres database. 
5. have a docker compose file to handle the hosting of front end back end and database.
6. generate these files for you as a downloadable zip, or
7. change the frontend to produce a static build served by nginx, or
8. add basic CORS and Docker healthchecks, or
9. add SQL migration using migrate.
