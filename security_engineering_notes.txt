STRIDE is a widely-used methodology for conducting threat modeling in the field of security engineering. Originally developed by Microsoft, itâ€™s an acronym that stands for six different types of security threats:

Spoofing: This threat involves an unauthorized user impersonating another user or device to gain access to a system. Spoofing can occur in many forms, such as email spoofing, IP address spoofing, or identity spoofing in authentication processes. Mitigation strategies include strong authentication mechanisms like two-factor authentication, digital certificates, and biometric verification.
Tampering: This refers to the unauthorized modification of data. Tampering can happen at different levels, including network data, system files, or application data. To mitigate tampering threats, use data integrity checks such as cryptographic hash functions, digital signatures, and secure transmission protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security).
Repudiation: This involves an individual denying that they performed an action, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Repudiation threats are significant in legal and financial contexts where transaction non-repudiation is crucial. Mitigation strategies include robust logging, auditing capabilities, and the implementation of digital signatures and transaction receipts.
Information Disclosure: This threat is about unauthorized access to confidential information. It can occur through various means like data breaches, interception of data during transmission, or system infiltration. To protect against information disclosure, employ encryption, access controls, and secure communication channels.
Denial of Service (DoS): This threat aims at disrupting the availability of a service. It can be executed by overwhelming a system with requests or exploiting system vulnerabilities. Mitigation techniques include network security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and traffic analysis tools. Additionally, ensuring system redundancy and robust architecture can help maintain availability during an attack.
Elevation of Privilege: This occurs when a user or process gains higher access levels than initially intended, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions. This could be due to system vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or exploitation of system design flaws. To mitigate this threat, enforce the principle of least privilege, conduct regular system and application updates, and monitor for unusual activity.
