| **Definition**         | A formal document that outlines scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and deliverables for testing a specific release or project.              | A high-level, organizational approach describing test types, coverage, criteria, tools, and overall methodology.                                                 |
| **Purpose**            | Provides detailed instructions on *what*, *when*, *who*, *how*, and *with which resources* to execute tests.                                     | Guides *overall approach and philosophy* of testing across multiple projects, ensuring consistency and best practices.                                           |
| **Scope & Audience**   | Scoped to a specific release or project; intended for project stakeholders, test teams, and QA leads.                                            | Applies organization-wide; meant for test managers, QA leadership, and process architects.                                                                       |
| **Content Includes**   | Test objectives, entry/exit criteria, deliverables, resource assignments, schedule, environment, risks, dependencies, and traceability matrices. | Test levels (unit, integration, system), types (functional, performance, security), quality metrics, tool usage, automation approach, and optimization strategy. |
| **Approach Detailing** | Highly detailed—defines test cases, schedules, resources at a granular level.                                                                    | High-level—defines *the “how” and “why”* of test execution, rather than the specifics.                                                                           |
| **Change Frequency**   | Updated per project or release; evolves with project lifecycle.                                                                                  | Stable; updated infrequently as part of organizational policy evolution.                                                                                         |
| **Who Prepares**       | Created and maintained by Test/QA leads for each project.                                                                                        | Developed by QA managers or senior test architects at an organizational level.                                                                                   |
| **Examples**           | “Test login functionality using these credentials during week 2; use Chrome and Firefox on staging environment.”                                 | “Adopt automation for regression tests; perform security testing for every major release; use tool X for performance.”                                           |
| **Relationship**       | Test Plan follows and is guided by the Test Strategy; is a concrete instantiation of the overall strategy.                                       | Test Strategy sets the direction, and multiple Test Plans across projects implement that direction.                                                              |
