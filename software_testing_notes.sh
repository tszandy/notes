Capacity Testing
    Tests how many users the system can handle before performance dips below acceptable levels. By testing a software’s capacity it helps developers anticipate issues in terms of scalability and future user-base growth. 
Load Testing
    Confirms that the system can handle the required number of users and still operate at a high level of performance. This ensures that there is no day to day issues in performance. 
Volume Testing
    Checks that the software can handle and process a large amount of data at once without breaking, slowing down, or losing any information.  
Stress Testing
    Intentionally tries to break the software by simulating a number of users that greatly exceeds expectations. The launch day of a new iPhone and the sudden spike in user traffic on the Apple website is a good example of a stress test in the real world. https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-store-crashes-as-iphone-6-goes-on-sale-2014-9?r=US&IR=T
Soak Testing
    Simulates high traffic for an extended period of time. Checks the software’s ability to tolerate extended periods of high traffic.
