Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to make web development faster and more efficient. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap), which come with pre-designed components like buttons, cards, and navigation bars, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that allow you to build custom designs directly in your HTML markup.
